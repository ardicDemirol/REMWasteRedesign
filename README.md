## üé® Features & Design Decisions

- **Modern, Clean UI**: Redesigned from scratch with a focus on clarity, accessibility, and professionalism using Tailwind CSS.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: All UI elements (filters, skip cards, modals, theme toggle) are modular React components for maintainability and reusability.
- **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode toggle; all theme colors managed centrally for consistency.
- **API-Driven**: Skip size data is dynamically fetched and normalized from the provided API for real-time accuracy.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, full keyboard navigation, and inclusive design.
- **Enhanced UX**:
  - Animated modals & transitions
  - Intuitive filtering & sorting controls
  - Visual feedback for selections
  - Robust error & empty-state handling
  - Mobile-friendly touch targets

## üì± Responsiveness

- **Mobile-First**: Designed primarily for mobile, then enhanced for desktop.
- **Responsive Grid**: Tailwind ensures seamless adaptation from single-column to multi-column layouts.
- **Touch-Friendly**: All interactive elements optimized for touch devices.

## ü§ñ Use of AI Tools

- **GitHub Copilot**: Extensively used for code generation, refactoring, and rapid prototyping.
- **AI-Assisted Design**: Leveraged Copilot for Tailwind class suggestions, accessibility, and documentation.
- **Productivity**: AI tools accelerated development and enabled a focus on higher-level design/UX.

---

## üß© Challenges & Solutions

- **API Data Mapping**: Created utility functions to normalize and enrich API responses for UI needs.
- **State Management**: Utilized React hooks and memoization for managing filters, sorting, and modal states.
- **Responsiveness**: Achieved pixel-perfect layouts using Tailwind's grid/flex utilities and custom media queries.
- **Theme Consistency**: Centralized theme management for scalability and easy maintenance.
- **Dropdown/Popover Logic**: Custom logic ensures accessibility and robust interaction handling.
